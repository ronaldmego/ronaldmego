**15+ years** turning messy enterprise data into strategic gold across **telecom, fintech, and e-commerce**. Now building the future of **Data Governance + AI** for LATAM enterprises.

I believe **enterprise AI without governance is just expensive chaos**.

```
Data Strategy → Governance Foundation → Safe AI Adoption → $10M ARR
Skip governance, and you're building castles on quicksand.
```

## Current Projects

- 🎯 [OpenClaw Command Center](https://github.com/ronaldmego/openclaw-command-center) - AI agent task management and orchestration system
- 📊 [Claude Code Usage Dashboard](https://github.com/ronaldmego/claude-code-usage-dashboard) - Token usage analytics and cost optimization for AI teams
- 🤖 [OpenMetadata MCP Agent](https://github.com/ronaldmego/openmetadata-agent) - Conversational layer for data catalog exploration
- 🏢 [GalacticaIA](https://galacticaia.com) - Data Governance + AI consulting for LATAM enterprises
- 📝 [ronaldmego.com](https://ronaldmego.com) - Technical writing on Data + AI governance

## What I'm Building

Living in the intersection of **enterprise data strategy** and **AI-first development**. After 15+ years helping organizations scale data platforms for 50M+ users, now focused on solving the "**agent sprawl**" problem for enterprises.

**The Mission:** Help LATAM companies adopt AI safely without breaking their data foundations.

**The Thesis:** Every enterprise will need a "**Data Governance for AI**" strategy. We're building the tools and playbooks to make it happen.

## Stack & Philosophy

- **Languages:** Python (data), SQL (everything), Node.js (web), bash (glue)
- **Data Stack:** PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, Supabase, OpenMetadata, Airflow
- **AI Stack:** Claude (Opus + Sonnet), OpenClaw, MCP servers, custom agents
- **Deployment:** Docker, Coolify, self-hosted on VPS (control freak about data)
- **Approach:** Build in public, ship fast, measure everything

> "Vibe coding meets enterprise rigor" - I prototype with AI agents, then harden for production

## Experience

- **2025-**: Head of Data Analytics and Digital @ Tigo (Millicom) - Leading AI adoption strategy
- **2009-2024**: 15+ years across Telefónica, fintech, and e-commerce - Built data platforms serving 50M+ users
- **2024**: MIT Data Leadership Diploma - Bridging technical and strategic perspectives
- **2016-2018**: MBA from PAD - Because data people need business sense too

## Recognition

- **Featured Work:** OpenClaw ecosystem contributor, MCP server author
- **Speaking:** Data + AI governance for LATAM enterprises
- **Writing:** Technical posts on agent orchestration and data strategy
- **Community:** Building tools that solve real enterprise problems, not demos

## Philosophy

**"Enterprise-grade AI starts with enterprise-grade data."**

I build tools to solve my own problems at scale, then share them with the community. Currently exploring how **Data Governance** becomes the competitive moat for AI-first companies.

**Random Facts:**
- Run Pepa 🐷, my 24/7 AI partner, on a self-hosted VPS
- Coffee-powered productivity (Panama has excellent coffee)
- Kickboxing enthusiast (when not debugging agents)
- Father to Galatea (my biggest motivation for building something meaningful)
- Peruvian living in Panama, serving LATAM enterprises globally
